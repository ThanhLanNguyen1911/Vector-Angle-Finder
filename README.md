# Vector-Angle-Finder
A mathematical function(vectorangleB) used for finding an angle(radian) between two position vectors
The function takes totally six parameters with three 3D coordinate parameters xyz for the first vector and the other three for the second vector.It returns an angle in radian between those two vectors.
Note: two position vectors must be in global space or relative to the origin.
Application: Use for determining the angles created by a point(position vector) and other points in 3D space that made up geometries(polygons) such as a triangle that's commonly needed to determine if the point is inside the polygon or not in 3D graphics.
